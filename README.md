# Summary

Result-oriented software development professional with 7+ years of hands-on experience. During my career, Iâ€™ve been involved in every stage of SDLC (from requirement gathering to deployment). In my software development journey, I gave my knowledge & skills to bespoke web applications for e-commerce (B2B & B2C models) retailers, rental applications, fin-tech web applications & 3D models for the building/construction industry. I always use OOP concepts, data structures & algorithms and best coding practices such as clean code, SOLID, DRY, YAGNI & KISS principles. Throughout my journey, Iâ€™ve used various programming languages, frameworks, technologies & tools. Iâ€™m a self-taught, fast learning, supportive team player and I quickly adapt to any kind of working environment.
